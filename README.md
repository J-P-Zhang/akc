# Automatic knowledge classification based on keyword co-occurrrence network
Short for automatic knowledge classification, akc is an R package used to carry out keyword classification based on netword science (mainly community detection techniques), using bibliometric data. However, these provided functions are general, and could be extended to solve other tasks in text mining as well.   
Generally provides a tidy framework of data manipulation supported by dplyr, akc was written in data.table when necessary to guarantee the performance for big data analysis. Meanwhile, akc also utilizes the state-of-the-art text mining functions provided by stringr,tidytext,textstem and network analysis functions provided by igraph,tidygraph and ggraph. Pipe %>% has been exported from magrittr and could be used directly in akc.
